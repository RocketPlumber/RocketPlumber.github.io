	<h2>Who am I?</h2>
	<p>I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at NYU Abu Dhabi, currently studying abroad at NYU Florence. I'm interested in Game Design, Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Outside of academics, I also dabble in writing, photography and filmmaking. I have a blog, where I've written about everything from self-driving cars to the design of <i>Doom</i>. I'm currently studying away in Florence, Italy, where I enjoy film photography, </p>

	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<h3>Force Ship</h3>
	<p>Force Ship is a simple 3D shoot-em-up game played using a wearable motion controller. In Force Ship, the player must channel the mystical Force through the motions of their hand to navigate their spacecraft through an asteroid field. I built Force Ship in Unity, and used Arduino to make a motion controller.</p>
	<h3>BreakTris</h3>
	<p>Tetris meets Breakout! In BreakTris, players standing at opposite ends of a table fight for control of the board, as one player places Tetris blocks to make lines and move blocks towards the Breakout player, while the Breakout player attempts to break those blocks and reach the other side of the board. BreakTris was built in Java and Processing, and was featured at the NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center Open Studios Exhibition, 2016.</p>

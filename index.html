							<h1><b>About Me</b></h1>
							<br>
							<p>I'm a junior Computer Science student at NYU Abu Dhabi. I'm interested in Game Design, Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, VR, and learning languages. Outside of academics, I also dabble in writing, photography and filmmaking. I have a <u><a href = "https://shantanubhatia.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">blog</a></u>, where I've written about everything from self-driving cars to the design of <i>Doom</i>. I spent my last summer at <a href="http://lam.ba/en/">Lamba</a> in Dubai, learning the ins and outs of game design, and am still seeking an opportunity for summer 2018. If you need an intern who's good with web development, game development and scripting, working in teams and using Git well, please contact me!.</p>
							<br>
							<h1><b>Projects</b></h1>
							<br>
							<h2>Force Ship</h2>
							<p>Force Ship is a simple 3D shoot-em-up game played using a wearable motion controller. In Force Ship, the player must channel the mystical Force through the motions of their hand to navigate their spacecraft through an asteroid field. I built Force Ship in Unity, and used Arduino to make a motion controller.</p>
							<h2>BreakTris</h2>
							<p>Tetris meets Breakout! In BreakTris, players standing at opposite ends of a table fight for control of the board, as one player places Tetris blocks to make lines and move blocks towards the Breakout player, while the Breakout player attempts to break those blocks and reach the other side of the board. BreakTris was built in Java and Processing, and was featured at the NYU Abu Dhabi Arts Center Open Studios Exhibition, 2016.</p>
							<h2>Destinator</h2>
							<p>Destinator is an IBM Watson-based travel guide app. Using Personality Insights and an analysis of your Twitter feed, Destinator will match your personality type to one in its database and recommend a travel location based on where it thinks you'd like to go. Destinator was initially created for the 2016 IBM-Etihad Hackathon held in Abu Dhabi.</p>
